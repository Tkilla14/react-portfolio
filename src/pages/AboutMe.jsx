          <p>My name is Tucker Killian. I love technology. I am a big nerd, im into superheros, the concept of magic. My dream job is to be an inventor. My heros are Tesla, Einstein, Oppenhiemer, Edison & Musk. I fell in love with coding because I wanted to be like those guys to create somthing out of nothing. To create TRUE magic. I have so many ideas bouncing around in my head that I want to make a reality & I truly feel like full stack development was a professional first step. I have created many projects before. I understand C# for game dev. I have created websites using software such as wordpress and Appypie. I love graphic design. I know how to use Blender, UnReal, Unity, Canva & WordPress. Not to mention everything I have learned in the UofM bootcamp.
